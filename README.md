# MEDICONNECT — Secure Application Platform

MEDICONNECT is a security-focused platform designed to host a compliant web application environment integrating HTML interfaces, a protected server, firewall logic, and GDPR-aligned data-handling principles.

The project demonstrates strong understanding of network configuration, user data protection, access control, and privacy-first architecture.  
It also includes early work on secure form submissions and server-side processing.  
This platform is currently evolving toward a fully operational secure web service.
